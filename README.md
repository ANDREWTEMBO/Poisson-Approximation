# Poisson-Approximation
  Python package for fast and accurate Poisson probability approximations using a hybrid Normal-Gamma model with Edgeworth correction. It automatically adapts based on the Poisson rate (Î»), offering improved speed and accuracy for both low and high event rates. Includes refined statistical adjustments and a sigmoid-based switching mechanism
